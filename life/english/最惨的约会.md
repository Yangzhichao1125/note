# 最惨的约会

那次并非因为她

it wasn't because of her

那是我犯的错

it was a mistake I made

我很年轻，马上就是一名大学新生了

I was young I was going to become a freshman in college

我邀请了我家教堂的一个女孩出去约会

so I had this girl that went to my church to go out

我分期买了一双鞋子

And so I had some shoes in layaway

这双鞋纸是八个月分期付款买的

and I had the shoes in layaway for eight months

当我在分期付款买这双鞋子的时候

and when I put the shoes in layaway

我那时的脚是9.5码-10码

I was um about a nine and a half then

当我分期付款拿到鞋子的时候

When I got him out of layaway

该死的是我的脚已经11码半了

Hell I was 11 and a half

然后我买完鞋子就回家了

so I bought the shoes and I took them home

当我把脚塞进鞋里的时候

And when I stuck my foot in

已经塞得很紧了

it was jammed tight

但你懂的，皮鞋多穿几次的话

but you know leather you wear them a little bit

就没那么紧了

They're gonna ease out 

然后我开车去接那女生

so I picked a girl up 

我开的是我爸的车

now I've used my father's car

在那个年代没有人的刹车时碟刹

and you know back then everybody didn't have disc brakes

那时的车都是鼓式刹车的

You know some people had drum brakes on they car

所以你刹车的时候要用力踩

so you had to really step on the brake

我的脚一定要用很大的力踩刹车

I'm putting a lot of pressure on these feet

鞋里的脚丫原本就已经在唱歌了

That was already snug in these shoes you understant

而我又在那又踩刹车又踩油门的

So I'm in that pumping braking pumping

我的脚开始肿了

my feet's swelling

我接到了女孩，然后我俩在排队

I pick the girl up and we are standing in line

她想要点爆米花

what she wanted some popcorn

我想要的是赶快找个地方坐下来

I need to get to a seat so I can sit down

因为我能感觉到我塞在鞋里的脚脉搏在跳动了

cuz my feet is inside the shoes actually pulsing

你可以感觉到鞋子里的血压了

you can feel the blood pressure in the shoe

我进了电影院

so I get in the movie 

我们一起看电影

We're watching the movie

蠢蠢的我当时决定

my little stupid self decides

把鞋脱下来，让脚丫子轻松一下

I'mma take my shoes off give my foot a break

然鹅，我不知道的是

I didn't know 

在看了30分钟电影之后

That about 30 minutes into the movie 

我的脚看起来就像是是KLump教授的脚一样

my foot look like professor Klump's foot

或是《肥佬教授》里面的

Or Nutty Proffessor

我的脚这么大了

it's this big

电影看完了

now the movie over

我再也穿不上鞋子了

I can't get the shoe on

但我一定要穿上它才行

but I gotta get this shoe on

因为这可是一双好鞋呀

cuz man these were some pretty shoes

女孩子不能看到我没穿鞋呀

and this girl can't see me 

但我怎么也穿不上

so I couldn't get the shoe on

你们知道的，你可以把自己的手指当作鞋拔子一样插进鞋里

and so you know you stick you finger in these use it as a shoehorn

我的手指都被扯下来了

I tore the fingernail off of my 

我的两只手都在流血

Both my fingers was bleeding

因为我想把脚塞进鞋里

cuz I was trying to get them in here

我满手都是血

now I got blood on my hads

我走过那个过道

but I'm going up the aisle

泪流满面

and I'm crying

我自己都不知道自己在哭

I don't even realize I'm crying

那个女孩扭过头跟我说

till the girl turned to me and said

哦，原来你这么喜欢这部电影

oh you really enjoyed the movie

我开车送她回家

so I drove the girl home

这就是为什么说这是最惨的一次约会了

Here is what made it a bad date

她邀请我上她家

she invited me in

我那时侯17岁，这个真的是美梦成真了

I mean I'm 17 this is dream come true

我被她邀请去她家了

I got invited in

但我不能进去

but I can't go in here

因为我要回家才行

cuz hell I got to go home

我送她回家的路上我哭了一路

cuz I'd cried all the way home

"我真不敢相信，你看了这个电影后居然如此感动"

I can't believe you feel this way about that movie

才不是什么狗屁电影，是老子的脚啦

ain't that damn movie my feet

我回到家后，鞋子怎么也脱不下来了

I got home and I couldn't get the shoes off

要把鞋子弄烂才行

so I had to ruin the shoes

我得弄把刀把鞋底和鞋子分开

I had to got a butcher knife and separate the sole from the shoe

还是脱不下来

I still couldn't get it off

但好受了一点

but I had some relief

我的脚趾像这样

my toes did like this
